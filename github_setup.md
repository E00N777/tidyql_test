# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Your memory vulnerabilities test project is now complete with all vulnerabilities and their fixes committed. To push this to GitHub, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub
- Go to https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `memory-vulnerabilities-test` (or your preferred name)
- Description: "A comprehensive C/C++ test project demonstrating various classic memory vulnerabilities and their secure fixes"
- Make it public or private as desired
- Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## 2. Push to GitHub
After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/memory-vulnerabilities-test.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Project Structure Summary

### Vulnerabilities Implemented:
- **Buffer Overflows**: Stack overflow, heap overflow, string copy overflow
- **Use-After-Free**: Basic and complex scenarios
- **Double Free**: Basic and alias pointer scenarios
- **Memory Leaks**: Basic and conditional branch scenarios
- **Dangling Pointers**: Basic and complex data structures
- **Uninitialized Memory**: Basic variables and complex structures
- **Integer Overflows**: Basic arithmetic and memory allocation
- **C-specific Vulnerabilities**: Format string, heap corruption, stack smashing, function pointer corruption, TOCTOU

### Security Fixes Applied:
- **RAII patterns** for automatic resource management
- **Smart pointers** for memory safety
- **Bounds checking** for buffer operations
- **Safe string functions** (strncpy, snprintf, etc.)
- **Proper initialization** of all variables
- **Input validation** and error handling

### Commit History:
1. **Initial commit**: All vulnerabilities implemented
2. **First fix**: C++ secure implementations using RAII and smart pointers
3. **Second fix**: C secure implementations using bounds checking and safe alternatives

## 4. Build Instructions

### Windows:
```bash
build.bat
```

### Linux/Mac:
```bash
make
```

### Run Tests:
```bash
./memory_vulnerabilities_test
```

The project demonstrates both vulnerable and secure implementations side-by-side, making it an excellent educational resource for understanding memory vulnerabilities and their prevention.
